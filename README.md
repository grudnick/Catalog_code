# Catalog_code
Code I use to manipulate and match catalogs

catalog_match_trans.py is an obsolete file.  It has been replaced by catalog_match_sky_trans.py, which is set up to work on catalogs in sky coordinates only and catalog_match_im_trans.py, which is designed to work on image coordinates.

These are called by image_coord_transform_im.py which contains the master cat_im_match() routine.
